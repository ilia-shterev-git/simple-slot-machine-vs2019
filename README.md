Repository for SimpleSlotMachine

This is a console application simulating Slot Machine. Test project with 14 test methods included. Some are MOQ tests, some simpel unit test. I left content of the packages folder. The WinZip would delete the folder if it were empty.

Basically it is based on generating random numbers ranging from 1 to 100. Every number would fall into a specific range and based on that it would be given a specific letter - S, P, B or *. Later it is analysed and checked which combinations are winning and with what coefficient.

I have two RTF files - one for the game requirements and the other I explain how I solved it. Both files are inside the solution folder.

Plenty of comments within the code.
